# Healthcare Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This data analytics project focuses on exploring healthcare information to identify relationships between various attributes, such as age, smoking status, and stroke status. By analyzing these attributes, we aim to gain insights into potential correlations and factors that may influence stroke occurrence within the dataset.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains comprehensive healthcare information, including attributes such as age, smoking status, stroke status, and potentially other relevant factors. It is structured to facilitate analysis and exploration of relationships between these attributes.

## Project Objectives
1. **Identify Correlations:** Utilize data analytics techniques to uncover correlations between different attributes within the healthcare dataset.
2. **Explore Relationships:** Investigate the relationships between age, smoking status, stroke, hypertension and potentially other relevant factors.
3. **Data Visualization:** Visualize the data to provide clear insights and facilitate understanding of the relationships between attributes.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleanse and prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform exploratory data analysis to gain initial insights into the distribution and characteristics of the data.
3. **Correlation Analysis:** Calculate correlations between attributes, focusing particularly on age, smoking status, stroke, heart disease and hypertension.
4. **Visualization:** Generate visualizations such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices to present the relationships between attributes effectively.

## Results
The findings from this data analytics project will provide valuable insights into the relationships between attributes in dataset.
